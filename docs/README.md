# About ACM
ACM & ACM-W at UCF organizes and promotes group activities, such as visits to computer-related businesses, conferences, and museums. During our GBMs we discuss relative political issues regarding computing, have guest speakers/lecturers, promote internships and co-ops within computer science, as well as whiteboard code/pair program. These activities are intended not only to further our knowledge of computer systems, but also help us build a cohesive community of computing enthusiasts.

ACM & ACM-W at UCF also periodically invites guest speakers to make presentations at UCF for our collective enrichment. ACM & ACM-W members are encouraged to attend these presentations, as are any interested community members. Members are also encouraged to reach out if they desire a specific speaker to come to UCF!
